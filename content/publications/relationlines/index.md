abstract: "The increased accessibility of urban sensor data and the popularity of social network applications is enabling the discovery of crowd mobility and personal communication patterns. However, studying the egocentric relationships of an individual (i.e., the egocentric relations) can be very challenging because available data may refer to direct contacts, such as phone calls between individuals, or indirect contacts, such as paired location presence. In this paper, we develop methods to integrate three facets extracted from heterogeneous urban data (timelines, calls and locations) through a progressive visual reasoning and inspection scheme. Our approach uses a detect-and-filter scheme, such that, prior to visual refinement and analysis, a coarse detection is performed to extract the target individual and construct the timeline of the target. It then detects spatio-temporal co-occurrences or call-based contacts to develop the egocentric network of the individual. The filtering stage is enhanced with a line-based visual reasoning interface that facilitates flexible and comprehensive investigation of egocentric relationships and connections in terms of time, space and social networks. The integrated system, RelationLines, is demonstrated using a dataset that contains taxi GPS data, cell-base mobility data, mobile calling data, microblog data and POI data of a city with millions of citizens. We examine the effectiveness and efficiency of our system by three case studies and user review."
