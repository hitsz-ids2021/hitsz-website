DRGraph achieves a linear complexity for the computation and memory consumption, and scales up to large-scale graphs with millions of nodes.

Recently, image enhance-ment approaches have yielded impressive progress. However,existing methods still suffer from three main problems: (1)low-light images usually are high-contrast. Existing methodsmay fail to recover images details in extremely dark or brightareas; (2) current methods cannot precisely correct the colorof low-light images; (3) when the object edges are unclear,the pixel-wise loss may treat pixels of different objectsequally and produce blurry images. In this paper, we proposea two-stage method called Edge-Enhanced Multi-ExposureFusion Network (EEMEFN) to enhance extremely low-lightimages. In the first stage, we employ a multi-exposure fusionmodule to address the high contrast and color bias issues. Wesynthesize a set of images with different exposure time froma single image and construct an accurate normal-light imageby combining well-exposed areas under different illuminationconditions. Thus, it can produce realistic initial images withcorrect color from extremely noisy and low-light images.Secondly, we introduce an edge enhancement module torefine the initial images with the help of the edge information.Therefore, our method can reconstruct high-quality imageswith sharp edges when minimizing the pixel-wise loss.

Aggregate queries are implicitly executed through such a process. Datasets are constantly extremely large; thus, the response time should be accelerated by calculating predefined data cubes. However, the queries are limited to the predefined binning schema of preprocessed data cubes. Such limitation hinders analysts' flexible adjustment of visual specifications to investigate the implicit patterns in the data effectively. Particularly, RSATree enables arbitrary queries and flexible binning strategies by leveraging three schemes, namely, an R-tree-based space partitioning scheme to catch the data distribution, a locality-sensitive hashing technique to achieve locality-preserving random access to data items, and a summed area table scheme to support interactive query of aggregated values with a linear computational complexity. This study presents and implements a web-based visual query system that supports visual specification, query, and exploration of large-scale tabular data with user-adjustable granularities. We demonstrate the efficiency and utility of our approach by performing various experiments on real-world datasets and analyzing time and space complexity.","tags":["Aggregate query","visual query","large-scale data visualization","R-tree","summed area table","hashing"],"title":"RSATree: Distribution-AwareData Representation of Large-Scale Tabular Datasets for Flexible Visual Query","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Zhaosong Huang","Ye Zhao","Wei Chen","Shengjie Gao","Kejie Yu","Weixia Xu","Mingjie Tang","Minfeng Zhu","Mingliang Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"664b6a4cbe2e95a5319c3cabfaef4e7c","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/nlp-urban/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/nlp-urban/","section":"publications","summary":"Visual querying is essential for interactively exploring massive trajectory data. However, the data uncertainty imposes profound challenges to fulfill advanced analytics requirements. On the one hand, many underlying data does not contain accurate geographic coordinates, e.g., positions of a mobile phone only refer to the regions (i.e., mobile cell stations) in which it resides, instead of accurate GPS coordinates. On the other hand, domain experts and general users prefer a natural way, such as using a natural language sentence, to access and analyze massive movement data. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that can extract spatial-temporal constraints from a textual sentence and support an effective query method over uncertain mobile trajectory data. It is built up on encoding massive, spatially uncertain trajectories by the semantic information of the POIs and regions covered by them, and then storing the trajectory documents in text database with an effective indexing scheme. The visual interface facilitates query condition specification, situation-aware visualization, and semantic exploration of large trajectory data. Usage scenarios on real-world human mobility datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","tags":["Natural-language-based Visual Query","Spatial Uncertaity","Trajectory Exploration"],"title":"A Natural-language-based Visual Query Approach of Uncertain Human Trajectories","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Yating Wei","Honghui Mei","Ying Zhao","Shuyue Zhou","Bingru Lin","Haojing Jiang","Wei Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"a47184a8962ab5d03ded333d295fbd8f","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/evaluating-scatterplots/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/evaluating-scatterplots/","section":"publications","summary":"Scatterplots are frequently scaled to fit display areas in multi-view and multi-device data analysis environments. A common method used for scaling is to enlarge or shrink the entire scatterplot together with the inside points synchronously and proportionally. This process is called geometric scaling. However, geometric scaling of scatterplots may cause a perceptual bias, that is, the perceived and physical values of visual features may be dissociated with respect to geometric scaling. For example, if a scatterplot is projected from a laptop to a large projector screen, then observers may feel that the scatterplot shown on the projector has fewer points than that viewed on the laptop. This paper presents an evaluation study on the perceptual bias of visual features in scatterplots caused by geometric scaling. The study focuses on three fundamental visual features (i.e., numerosity, correlation, and cluster separation) and three hypotheses that are formulated on the basis of our experience. We carefully design three controlled experiments by using well-prepared synthetic data and recruit participants to complete the experiments on the basis of their subjective experience. With a detailed analysis of the experimental results, we obtain a set of instructive findings. First, geometric scaling causes a bias that has a linear relationship with the scale ratio. Second, no significant difference exists between the biases measured from normally and uniformly distributed scatterplots. Third, changing the point radius can correct the bias to a certain extent. These findings can be used to inspire the design decisions of scatterplots in various scenarios.","tags":["Evaluation","scatterplot","geometric scaling","bias","perceptual consistency"],"title":"Evaluating Perceptual Bias During Geometric Scaling of Scatterplots","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Ying Zhao","Xiaobo Luo","Xiaoru Lin","Hairong Wang","Xiaoyan Kui","Fangfang Zhou","Jinsong Wang","Yi Chen","Wei Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"3ff15fab5675d7458c1e6f0b0bb53de8","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/radiovis/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/radiovis/","section":"publications","summary":"Traditional radio monitoring and management largely depend on radio spectrum data analysis, which requires considerable domain experience and heavy cognition effort and frequently results in incorrect signal judgment and incomprehensive situation awareness.

This paper introduces a visual analytics approach for electromagnetic situation awareness. Guided by a detailed scenario and requirement analysis, we first propose a signal clustering method to process radio signal data and a situation assessment model to obtain qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the electromagnetic situations. We then design a two-module interface with a set of visualization views and interactions to help radio supervisors perceive and understand the electromagnetic situations by a joint analysis of radio signal data and radio spectrum data.

Current methods first generate an initial image with rough shape and color, and then refine the initial image to a high-resolution one.

If the initial image is not well initialized, the following processes can hardly refine the image to a satisfactory quality. (2) Each word contributes a different level of importance when depicting different image contents, however, unchanged text representation is used in existing image refinement processes. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (DM-GAN) to generate high-quality images. The proposed method introduces a dynamic memory module to refine fuzzy image contents, when the initial images are not well generated. A memory writing gate is designed to select the important text information based on the initial image content, which enables our method to accurately generate images from the text description. We also utilize a response gate to adaptively fuse the information read from the memories and the image features. We evaluate the DM-GAN model on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset and the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our DM-GAN model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.","tags":["Generative Adversarial Networks","Text-to-Image Synthesis"],"title":"DM-GAN: Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Networks for Text-to-Image Synthesis.","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Minfeng Zhu","Wei Chen","Jiazhi Xia","Yuxin Ma","Yankong Zhang","Yuetong Luo","Zhaosong Huang","Liangjun Liu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1552296004,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552296004,"objectID":"6b8742d95221bd64017ace6014deab59","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/location2vec/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T17:20:04+08:00","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/location2vec/","section":"publications","summary":"Understanding the relationship between urban locations is an essential task in urban planning and transportation management.

When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats.

The kernel of ECharts is a suite of declarative visual design language that customizes built-in chart types. The underlying streaming architecture, together with a high-performance graphics renderer based on HTML5 canvas, enables the high expandability and performance of ECharts. We report the design, implementation, and applications of ECharts with a diverse variety of examples. We compare the utility and performance of ECharts with C3.js, HighCharts, and Chart.js.

However, designing an appropriate transfer function is a trial-and-error process and remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel volume exploration scheme that explores volumetric structures in the feature space by modeling the space using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Our new approach has three distinctive advantages. First, an initial feature separation can be automatically achieved through GMM estimation. Second, the calculated Gaussians can be directly mapped to a set of elliptical transfer functions (ETFs), facilitating a fast pre-integrated volume rendering process. Third, an inexperienced user can flexibly manipulate the ETFs with the assistance of a suite of simple widgets, and discover potential features with several interactions. We further extend the GMM-based exploration scheme to time-varying data sets using an incremental GMM estimation algorithm. The algorithm estimates the GMM for one time step by using itself and the GMM generated from its previous steps. Sequentially applying the incremental algorithm to all time steps in a selected time interval yields a preliminary classification for each time step. In addition, the computed ETFs can be freely adjusted. The adjustments are then automatically propagated to other time steps. In this way, coherent user-guided exploration of a given time interval is achieved. Our GPU implementation demonstrates interactive performance and good scalability. The effectiveness of our approach is verified on several data sets.","tags":["Volume classification","volume rendering","Gaussian mixture model","time-varying data","temporal coherence"],"title":"Efficient Volume Exploration Using the Gaussian Mixture Model.","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Jin Huang","Zherong Pan","Guoning Chen","Wei Chen","Hujun Bao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"a4c60a5fca98818b5ea41027970b709f","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/lic/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T08:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/lic/","section":"publications","summary":"Image-space line integral convolution (LIC) is a popular scheme for visualizing surface vector fields due to its simplicity and high efficiency. To avoid inconsistencies or color blur during the user interactions, existing approaches employ surface parameterization or 3D volume texture schemes. However, they often require expensive computation or memory cost, and cannot achieve consistent results in terms of both the granularity and color distribution on different scales. This paper introduces a novel image-space surface flow visualization approach that preserves the coherence during user interactions. To make the noise texture under different viewpoints coherent, we propose to precompute a sequence of mipmap noise textures in a coarse-to-fine manner for consistent transition, and map the textures onto each triangle with randomly assigned and constant texture coordinates. Further, a standard image-space LIC is performed to generate the flow texture. The proposed approach is simple and GPU-friendly, and can be easily combined with various texture-based flow visualization techniques. By leveraging viewpoint-dependent backward tracing and mipmap noise phase, our method can be incorporated with the image-based flow visualization (IBFV) technique for coherent visualization of unsteady flows.

For very large time series data with thousands of items, how to visually present ranking changes is an interesting challenge.

A TCP tree is generated by partitioning the information-theoretic correlation time series into pieces with respect to the variable hierarchy and temporal variations, and reorganizing these pieces into a hierarchically nested structure. The visual exploration of a TCP tree provides a sparse data traversal of the correlation variations and a situation-aware analysis of correlations among variables.

In this paper, we develop methods to integrate three facets extracted from heterogeneous urban data (timelines, calls and locations) through a progressive visual reasoning and inspection scheme. Our approach uses a detect-and-filter scheme, such that, prior to visual refinement and analysis, a coarse detection is performed to extract the target individual and construct the timeline of the target. It then detects spatio-temporal co-occurrences or call-based contacts to develop the egocentric network of the individual. The filtering stage is enhanced with a line-based visual reasoning interface that facilitates flexible and comprehensive investigation of egocentric relationships and connections in terms of time, space and social networks. The integrated system, RelationLines, is demonstrated using a dataset that contains taxi GPS data, cell-base mobility data, mobile calling data, microblog data and POI data of a city with millions of citizens.

We propose a new LTSD-GD view, which is constructed by mapping LTSD and GD to the x axis and y axis using 1D multidimensional scaling, respectively. Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction methods that preserve various kinds of distances among points, the LTSD-GD view presents the distribution of pointwise LTS (x axis) and the variation of LTS in structures (the combination of x axis and y axis).

Existing tools typically require users to select and brush geospatial regions on a map when retrieving and exploring taxi trajectories and passenger trips.

In this paper, we present SemanticTraj, a new method for managing and visualizing taxi trajectory data in an intuitive, semantic rich, and efficient means. With SemanticTraj, domain and public users can find answers to the aforementioned questions easily through direct queries based on the terms. They can also interactively explore the retrieved data in visualizations enhanced by semantic information of the trajectories and trips. In particular, taxi trajectories are converted into taxi documents through a textualization transformation process. This process maps GPS points into a series of street/POI names and pick-up/drop-off locations. It also converts vehicle speeds into user-defined descriptive terms. Then, a corpus of taxi documents is formed and indexed to enable flexible semantic queries over a text search engine. Semantic labels and meta-summaries of the results are integrated with a set of visualizations in a SemanticTraj prototype, which helps users study taxi trajectories quickly and easily. A set of usage scenarios are presented to show the usability of the system.

Meanwhile, each type of data has specific advantages and limitations for social transportation, and one data type alone is not capable of describing the overall state of a transportation system. Systematic data fusing approaches or frameworks for combining social signal data with different features, structures, resolutions, and precision are needed. Second, data processing and mining techniques, such as natural language processing and analysis of streaming data, require further revolutions in effective utilization of real-time traffic information. Third, social data are connected to cyber and physical spaces. To address practical problems in social transportation, a suite of schemes are demanded for realizing big data in social transportation systems, such as crowdsourcing, visual analysis, and task-based services. In this paper, we overview data sources, analytical approaches, and application systems for social transportation, and we also suggest a few future research directions for this new social transportation field.","tags":["Big data","social transportation","intelligent transportation system","data analytics","crowdsourcing"],"title":"Big Data in Social Transportation.","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Hongsen Liao","Li Chen","Yingcai Wu","Yunhai Wang","Huizhang","Wei Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443657600,"objectID":"7fe665f11c842bc1ac2142120cc3d8b2","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/a-visual-voting-framework-for-weather-forecast-calibration/","publishdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/a-visual-voting-framework-for-weather-forecast-calibration/","section":"publications","summary":"Numerical weather predictions have been widely used for weather forecasting. Many large meteorological centers are producing highly accurate ensemble forecasts routinely to provide effective weather forecast services. However, biases frequently exist in forecast products because of various reasons, such as the imperfection of the weather forecast models. Failure to identify and neutralize the biases would result in unreliable forecast products that might mislead analysts; consequently, unreliable weather predictions are produced. The analog method has been commonly used to overcome the biases. Nevertheless, this method has some serious limitations including the difficulties in finding effective similar past forecasts, the large search space for proper parameters and the lack of support for interactive, real-time analysis. In this study, we develop a visual analytics system based on a novel voting framework to circumvent the problems. The framework adopts the idea of majority voting to combine judiciously the different variants of analog methods towards effective retrieval of the proper analogs for calibration. The system seamlessly integrates the analog methods into an interactive visualization pipeline with a set of coordinated views that characterizes the different methods. Instant visual hints are provided in the views to guide users in finding and refining analogs. We have worked closely with the domain experts in the meteorological research to develop the system. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated using two case studies. An informal evaluation with the experts proves the usability and usefulness of the system.","tags":["Weather forecast","analog method","calibration","majority voting","visual analytics"],"title":"A Visual Voting Framework for Weather Forecast Calibration.","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Haidong Chen","Song Zhang","Wei Chen","Honghui Mei","Jiawei Zhang","Huamin Qu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"318e1eb47ea5232ca31db890c1eb2865","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/uncertainty/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/uncertainty/","section":"publications","summary":"This paper presents an efficient visualization and exploration approach for modeling and characterizing the relationships and uncertainties in the context of a multidimensional ensemble dataset.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive visual analytics system, BoundarySeer, to help users gain insight into the changes of boundaries. Our system consists of four major viewers: 1) a global viewer to show boundary groups based on their similarity and the distribution of boundary attributes such as smoothness and perimeter; 2) a region viewer to display the regions encircled by the boundaries and how they are affected by boundary changes; 3) a trend viewer to reveal the temporal patterns in the boundary evolution and potential spatio-temporal correlations; 4) a directional change viewer to encode movements of boundary segments in different directions. Quantitative analyses of boundaries (e.g., similarity measurement and adaptive clustering) and intuitive visualizations (e.g., density map and ThemeRiver) are integrated into these viewers, which enable users to explore boundary changes from different aspects and at different scales.

With a set of analyst-determined training samples, VAET automatically estimates the saliency of each transaction in a large time-series using a probabilistic decision tree learner. It provides an effective time-of-saliency (TOS) map where the analysts can explore a large number of transactions at different time granularities. Interesting transactions are further encoded with KnotLines, a compact visual representation that captures both the temporal variations and the contextual connection of transactions. The analysts can thus explore, select, and investigate knotlines of interest.

We regard the entire multi-stage rendering pipeline as a process that generates signals on surfaces, and we formulate the simplification of the fragment shader as a global simplification problem across multi-shader stages. Three new shader simplification rules are proposed to solve the problem. First, the code transformation rule transforms fragment shader code to other shader stages in order to redistribute computations on pixels up to the level of geometry primitives. Second, the surface-wise approximation rule uses high-order polynomial basis functions on surfaces to approximate pixel-wise computations in the fragment shader. These approximations are pre-cached and simplify computations at runtime. Third, the surface subdivision rule tessellates surfaces into smaller patches. It combines with the previous two rules to approximate pixel-wise signals at different levels of tessellations with different computation times and visual errors. To evaluate simplified shaders using these simplification rules, we introduce a new cost model that includes the visual quality, rendering time and memory consumption. With these simplification rules and the cost model, we present an integrated shader simplification algorithm that is capable of automatically generating variants of simplified shaders and selecting a sequence of preferable shaders. Results show that the sequence of selected simplified shaders balance performance, accuracy and memory consumption well.","tags":["TGPU shader","real-time rendering","shader simplification","surface signal approximation"],"title":"Automatic Shader Simplification using Surface Signal Approximation.","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Long Zhang","Ying He","Jiazhi Xia","Xuexiang Xie","Wei Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1285200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1285200000,"objectID":"d174c892b01b196820a2a5f8de1ca2cb","permalink":"https://hitsz-ids2021.github.io/hitsz-website/publications/real-timeshape/","publishdate":"2010-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/hitsz-website/publications/real-timeshape/","section":"publications","summary":"This paper presents a novel object-space line drawing algorithm that can depict shapes with view-dependent feature lines in real time.

The most common multi-dimensional transfer function consists of a two-dimensional (2D) histogram with axes representing a subset of the feature space (e.g., value vs. value gradient magnitude), with each entry in the 2D histogram being the number of voxels at a given feature space pair. Users then assign color and opacity to the voxel distributions within the given feature space through the use of interactive widgets (e.g., box, circular, triangular selection). Unfortunately, such tools lead users through a trial-and-error approach as they assess which data values within the feature space map to a given area of interest within the volumetric space. In this work, we propose the addition of non-parametric clustering within the transfer function feature space in order to extract patterns and guide transfer function generation. We apply a non-parametric kernel density estimation to group voxels of similar features within the 2D histogram. These groups are then binned and colored based on their estimated density, and the user may interactively grow and shrink the binned regions to explore feature boundaries and extract regions of interest. We also extend this scheme to temporal volumetric data in which time steps of 2D histograms are composited into a histogram volume. A three-dimensional (3D) density estimation is then applied, and users can explore regions within the feature space across time without adjusting the transfer function at each time step. Our work enables users to effectively explore the structures found within a feature space of the volume and provide a context in which the user can understand how these structures relate to their volumetric data. We provide tools for enhanced exploration and manipulation of the transfer function, and we show that the initial transfer function generation serves as a reasonable base for volumetric rendering, reducing the trial-and-error overhead typically found in transfer function design.","tags":["Volume rendering","kernel density estimation","transfer function design","temporal volume rendering"],"title":"Structuring Feature Space: A Non-Parametric Method for Volumetric Transfer Function Generation.","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Wei Chen","Zi’ang Ding","Song Zhang","Anna MacKay-Brandt","Stephen Correia","Huamin Qu","John Allen Crow","David F.

However, these schemes mainly focus on the optimization of visualization in the 3D space where cluttering and occlusion make grasping even a few thousand fibers difficult. This paper introduces a novel interaction method that augments the 3D visualization with a 2D representation containing a low-dimensional embedding of the DTI fibers. This embedding preserves the relationship between the fibers and removes the visual clutter that is inherent in 3D renderings of the fibers. This new interface allows the user to manipulate the DTI fibers as both 3D curves and 2D embedded points and easily compare or validate his or her results in both domains.

Current solutions are ineffective for visualizing fibrous structures such as muscle, because typical datasets (CT or MRI) do not contain directional details. In this paper, we introduce a new muscle illustration approach that leverages diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and example-based texture synthesis techniques. Beginning with a volumetric diffusion tensor image, we reformulate it into a scalar field and an auxiliary guidance vector field to represent the structure and orientation of a muscle bundle. A muscle mask derived from the input diffusion tensor image is used to classify the muscle structure. The guidance vector field is further refined to remove noise and clarify structure. To simulate the internal appearance of the muscle, we propose a new two-dimensional examplebased solid texture synthesis algorithm that builds a solid texture constrained by the guidance vector field. Illustrating the constructed scalar field and solid texture efficiently highlights the global appearance of the muscle as well as the local shape and structure of the muscle fibers in an illustrative fashion.
